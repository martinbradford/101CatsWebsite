        Colour themes
    </title>
    <p>101Cats is built using the
        <control>MahApps</control>
        UI framework which supports Theming. <br/><br/> You can choose a theme to suit you by updating the
        <control>Theme</control>
        entry in
        <control>config.xml</control>
        . The configuration dialogue box does not currently support this, so you'll have to edit the configuration file
        manually using your favorite text editor. This must be done with some care - instructions are given <a
                href="Configuring-101Cats.topic">here</a></p>
    <p>Currently, only MahApps stock themes are supported. A future version may support theme customization. The stock
        themes are :</p>
    <p>&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Purple&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Lime&quot;,
        &quot;Emerald&quot;, &quot;Teal&quot;, &quot;Cyan&quot;, &quot;Cobalt&quot;, &quot;Indigo&quot;, &quot;Violet&quot;,
        &quot;Pink&quot;, &quot;Magenta&quot;, &quot;Crimson&quot;, &quot;Amber&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot;,
        &quot;Olive&quot;, &quot;Steel&quot;, &quot;Mauve&quot;, &quot;Taupe&quot;, &quot;Sienna&quot;</p>
    <p>and these base themes:</p>
    <p>&quot;Light&quot;, &quot;Dark&quot;</p>
    <p>I use the following :</p>
    <code-block lang="xml">
        &lt;Theme&gt;
            &lt;BaseTheme&gt;Dark.Cyan&lt;/BaseTheme&gt;
        &lt;/Theme&gt;
    </code-block>
    <p>which I find quite readable.</p>
    <p>At some point in the future, I'll get round to extending the configuration dialogue box to include theming.</p>
