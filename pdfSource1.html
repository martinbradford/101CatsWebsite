Any PC that is capable of reasonable performance in Windows should be sufficient. For a long time, the author ran it very successfully on an AMD Radeon 5600 with 16Gb of memory and it has demonstrably worked well on less powerful machines.</p><p id="204774524#gqbga5_13">101Cats was developed under Windows 10 and the development now continues under Windows 11. It should also work well under Windows 8.

The majority of controls are combo-boxes, sliders and toggle switches and operate as you would expect. The intention is that it should be largely mouse driven and sliders should react to mouse clicks, mouse drags and the rotation of the mouse wheel. Surprisingly, none of these interactions come without some programming effort and it is almost certainly the case that I have not implemented the mouse wheel on some of the less frequently used sliders - if you find one, ping me a message and I'll fix it in a future release. Where a slider has a sensible default value, it should respond to a double click by resetting to that value. Try setting the filter shift to some non-zero value, then double clicking it - it will reset back to zero. I have not implemented that on every slider - if you think that it should be present elsewhere, tell me and I'll add it in the future.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_4">The two meter controls are hand-carved code - I could not find any off-the-shelf meter control that I could use at a reasonable price. They were complex to implement and are still not perfect. The scales were determined by inspection and may not accurately reflect the values displayed on the radio front panel - if you find any glaring errors, let me know.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_5">The frequency displays are also hand-carved code. They respond to the mouse wheel which is the primary method of tuning. One digit is highlighted at all times and this is the digit that is varied by the mouse wheel. Clicking on a different digit will select it such that you can choose the tuning rate. You can also use the keyboard to temporarily adjust the tuning rate - hold down the &quot;ctrl&quot; key while you turn the mouse wheel to multiple the tuning rate by ten, the &quot;shift&quot; key multiplies it by 100 and &quot;ctrl&quot; + &quot;shift&quot; multiplies it by 1000. Double clicking in the frequency display rounds it off to the nearest kHz.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_6">You can also enter frequencies by typing them on the keyboard. If 101Cats is the application with focus, typing any digit on the keyboard will open up a data entry window where you can key in an exact frequency. Hitting &quot;enter&quot; will tune to the new frequency.</p><section><h2 id="12461495#other-functions" data-toc="other-functions#User-Interface.topic-other-functions">Other Functions</h2><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_9">The column of buttons down the right hand side of the window should be reasonably self-explanatory, but here are a few notes... &quot;TW&quot; opens the &quot;Trace Window&quot; which displays the data stream to and from the radio. It also allows you to enter CAT commands and send them to the radio. This is intended for me to debug the code - use it with care unless you are sure of what you are doing. It should not be possible to damage the radio through this window, but you certainly could get it into some strange state which is difficult to undo without a reset.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_10">&quot;External Tune&quot; saves the current power level and mode settings, then switches to AM, reduces the power to 10W and puts the radio into transmit. When you release the button, the radio is put back to receive and the previous power and mode are reinstated. In order to avoid tuning up on a frequency that is in use, right clicking this button will QSY up 3kHz before putting out the carrier and QSY back down on release. Obviously, this could result in you shifting to another busy frequency, but the FTdx101 has a good bandscope and it only takes a glance at the screen to know if it is safe to QSY up.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_11">The &quot;Mute&quot; button turns off both receivers. This is a toggle button - clicking it again will restore the receivers to their previous state.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_12">The &quot;To SDR&quot; and &quot;From SDR&quot; buttons transfer the current frequency between 101Cats and an external SDR program such as SDR Uno or SDR Console. I know that both of those programs implement a function to synchronise their tuning with that of an external radio, but this function is limited and did not match my style of operation. There is a more detailed explanation of this on another page of this Wiki.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_13">The &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; button swaps frequency and mode between Main and Sub.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_14">The &quot;Internal Tuner&quot; and &quot;Tune&quot; buttons do what they say - turn the internal tuner on/off and initiate a tuning cycle.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_15">The &quot;Zero In&quot; and &quot;CW Spot&quot; buttons also do what they say - only functional with the radio in CW mode.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_16">The &quot;Spectrum&quot; button opens up a second window that displays the radio's spectrum display and allows you to control it. The FTdx101 does not output spectrum data over the USB interface, so this window is only functional if you have the DVI output on the back panel connected to the PC via a video digitizer. This is too complex to describe here and will be the subject of another Wiki page.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_17">The &quot;Keyer Memory&quot; button brings up a dialogue box that roughly matches the functionality of a Yaesu FH-2 keypad. This window needs work - it is functional, but not polished.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_18">The &quot;History&quot; button brings up the &quot;Tuning History&quot; window. This is another &quot;work in progress&quot;, but already very useful. You can set a timeout (which defaults to 10 seconds) and, if the radio remains tuned to a frequency for more than this period of time, an entry will be made in the history window. Double clicking an entry in the history list will tune back to that frequency and mode. You can annotate an entry in the history list to remind yourself of what you heard there and you can clear the entire list or individual entries. Gone are the days when you were tuning around, heard an interesting DX station, made a mental note to go back and try to work it, then completely forgot the frequency he was on. It also helps to avoid &quot;finger trouble&quot; as you accidently jog the tuning knob and lose the station you were talking to!</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_19">The &quot;DX Cluster&quot; button brings up a window that displays the output of a DX Cluster server. This is very definitely a work-in-progress - it does work, but it has a lot of rough edges. It will be improved significantly in a future release.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_20">Below the buttons, you'll see &quot;APO Time&quot; and &quot;APO Enabled&quot; - these are Automatic Power Off. The box below &quot;APO Enabled&quot; is the count-down - if it gets to zero, the radio is powered off. Any activity in the window will reset the APO Timer.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_21">&quot;SWR Check&quot; turns on a High SWR warning function. If the radio reports a high SWR reading to 101Cats, then it will be forced out of transmit and a warning message box displayed. Note that, during antenna tuning the SWR may go high at times. 101Cats implements a delayon the High SWR warning function - this defaults to 1 second and can be configured via the configuration file.</p><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_22">Below the SWR Check box, there are several static text fields. The top one is the version number of 101Cats. Below that, there are three numeric fields - these are the lengths of various internal data queues and are there to assist with debugging the code. They should idle at zero and never go above four or five. The only exception to this is at startup when there is a lot of interaction between the application and the radio and you may see queue lengths increase significantly.</p></section><section><h2 id="12461495#speech-processor-controls" data-toc="speech-processor-controls#User-Interface.topic-speech-processor-controls">Speech Processor Controls</h2><p id="12461495#z8a8zm0_23">The speech processor on the FTdx101 series is more complex than that on many other radios and getting the setting wrong can make the transmission sound bad and, possibly, excessively wide. There are three sliders - &quot;Mic Gain&quot;, &quot;Speech Processor&quot; and &quot;AMC&quot; towards the bottom of the 101Cats window that control the speech processor parameters. There is also a toggle switch, &quot;Lock Processor&quot; which disables these controls. Getting the processor set to match your microphone and operating style can require a significant amount of effort and I wanted to guard against accidentally &quot;jogging&quot; a setting and undoing all my careful work!</p></section></article></div></section><section class="topic"><div><article class="article"><h1 class="main-title" id="-1997878713">Macros</h1><p id="-1997878713#-vmsqi0_3">V1.0.9.9 adds a simple Macro function. The &quot;Macros&quot; button (bottom centre of main screen) opens the Macros Window. This is divided into a 5x5 matrix of buttons that can be programmed to perform user defined tasks. A button is programmed by right clicking on it and selecting &quot;Edit&quot; from the context menu that pops up. In the dialogue box, give the macro a title, enter background and foreground colours for it and give it a definition. Currently, you specify colours as text strings - &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;LightBlue&quot; etc. Windows recognises a wide range of colours by name - experiment! If you enter a colour that Windows does not recognise, you will get an error message when you try to save the definition. At some point in the future, I'll put in the effort to change these to combo-boxes in order to simplify the data entry.</p><div class="container"><figure class="image-container"><img class="center image image-size" id="-1997878713#-vmsqi0_4" alt="MacroWindow.png" title="MacroWindow.png" src="D:/Users/marti/WritersideProjects/101CatsNewWiki/Writerside/images/MacroWindow.png" width="886" height="493"><figcaption class="center-text">MacroWindow.png</figcaption></figure></div><p id="-1997878713#-vmsqi0_5">The macro definition is currently a string containing one or more CAT commands.

You can compose the definition string with reference to the FTdx101 CAT command manual. Alternatively, the Trace Window (opened with the TW button) can help - the right hand list pane displays the commands that are sent to the radio. Perform the functions that you want to program onto the macro button via the 101Cats main window while observing the Trace Window (but do note that there will be other traffic displayed as well, so don't copy commands blindly, check them back to the CAT command manual if necessary.</p><div class="container"><figure class="image-container"><img class="center image image-size" id="-1997878713#-vmsqi0_6" alt="MacroDefinition.png" title="MacroDefinition.png" src="D:/Users/marti/WritersideProjects/101CatsNewWiki/Writerside/images/MacroDefinition.png" width="810" height="464"><figcaption class="center-text">MacroDefinition.png</figcaption></figure></div><p id="-1997878713#-vmsqi0_7">Be careful with the commands you send to the radio - particularly if you are not familiar with driving a radio via CAT commands. It should not be possible to physically damage the radio, but you could get it into a strange state that might require a factory reset!</p></article></div></section><section class="topic"><div><article class="article"><h1 class="main-title" id="-1902486706">Using an external SDR as a high resolution panadaptor</h1><p id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_3">OK, so the FTdx101 series of radios has an excellent panadaptor function via the screen on the front panel plus the external screen that can be plugged into the DVI socket on the rear panel. But the screen resolution is only moderate and there are benefits that can be had by connecting an external SDR unit such as an SDRPlay RSP1A. A unit such as this works with an application on the shack PC which processes the output of the SDR, tuning it to the required frequency, demodulating the RF and applying functions such as noise reduction and filtering.</p><p id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_4">The two leading SDR applications for Windows are SDR Console and SDR Uno. When paired up with a suitable SDR, these can make your PC function as a very nice general coverage receiver spanning frequencies from Long Wave all the way up to microwaves. They also include functions that will allow them to be interfaced to many modern HF transceivers to provide a high resolution panadaptor and/or an additional receiver.</p><p id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_5">Both SDR Uno and SDR Console include a function to synchronize themselves with an attached transceiver - including an FTdx101D. When this function is enabled, the tuning of the SDR application and the transceiver are locked together - spin the dial of the FTdx101D and the application on the PC will follow the tuned frequency, retune the PC application using the mouse wheel or keyboard and the FTdx101D will follow it.</p><p id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_6">If all you want is a better panadaptor, then the configuration is simple. Both SDR Console and SDR Uno make use of OmniRig as the interface for this synchronization. You need to install the SDR application of choice, install OmniRig, create a virtual port pair following the instructions here, configure one end of that virtual port pair into 101Cats and the other end into OmniRig. Finally, configure your SDR application to synchronize via OmniRig and it will all work well.</p><p id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_7">The issue comes if you want to sometimes use the SDR application as an additional independent receiver. Both SDR Console and SDR Uno have buttons on their windows to suspend the synchronization and you can then tune to a different frequency to that to which the FTdx101 is tuned - possibly in a completely different band if your antenna routing will permit it. Again, this works perfectly well - until you want to restore the synchronization. The restoration is just a case of clicking the button on the screen of the SDR application again, but neither SDR Console nor SDR Uno give you any function to specify which device, the FTdx101 or the SDR application, should be considered the master. It is all a question of timing and cannot be reliably predicted - you have found an interesting signal on either the FTdx101 or the RSP1A and want to listen to it on the other device, but you could easily find the the restored synchronization works in the opposite direction and you lose the frequency of interest.</p><p id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_8">In order to resolve this, 101Cats introduces a second interface to an external SDR application - the &quot;SDR Port&quot; that is referenced in the configuration screen. You create another virtual port pair, configure one side of that pair into the SDR Port of 101Cats and the other side into the CAT function of SDR Console or SDR Uno. Once you have done this, the two buttons &ldquo;To SDR&rdquo; and &ldquo;From SDR&rdquo; that appear on the right hand side of the main screen become active. If the synchronization has been turned off, then these buttons allow you to transfer the tuning in either direction in a controlled manner before re-enabling synchronization.</p><p id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_9"><span class="control" id="-1902486706#z3q3mgv_12">Note that there is a configuration setting which specifies which SDR application is being used. Currently, the only options are SDR Uno and SDR Console. This is a recent addition and not included in the configuration dialogue box - it is necessary to edit the configuration file manually in order to change it.

As well as controlling the radio itself, 101Cats also functions as a hub to allow multiple third-party applications to connect to the radio. It implements multiple virtual FTdx101s so that each third-party application thinks it has sole control of the radio and 101Cats takes care of routing commands and responses accordingly so that no two applications will block each other.</p><p id="1418898203#-27x798_4">101Cats makes use of an external virtual serial port driver application in order to establish the interfaces with the third-party applications. There are several virtual serial port driver applications available including com0com (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/</a>), Eltima Virtual Serial Port Driver (<a href="https://www.eltima.com/products/vspdxp/">https://www.eltima.com/products/vspdxp/</a>) and Eterlogic VIRTUAL SERIAL PORTS EMULATOR (<a href="https://eterlogic.com/Products.VSPE.html">https://eterlogic.com/Products.VSPE.html</a>). Com0com is probably the most widely used - it is free and works well. The others may have more modern user interfaces, but they cost money and don't seem to have any significant benefit over com0com. Note that Windows 11 is more touchy that previous versions about third-party drivers. Com0com is available both signed and unsigned - you probably want to install the unsigned version with Windows 11.</p><p id="1418898203#-27x798_5">Once you have chosen and installed your virtual serial port framework, you will have to create virtual serial port pairs to support the third-party applications that you wish to connect. Think of each virtual serial port pair as a virtual cable that can connect two applications together. You will need as many virtual serial port pairs as you have third-party applications to connect (actually, this may not be strictly true if you use Omnirig - see below).</p><p id="1418898203#-27x798_6">I use Com0com and the screenshot below shows my configuration:</p><div class="container"><figure class="image-container"><img class="center image image-size" id="1418898203#-27x798_7" alt="image" title="image" src="https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/assets/30900693/2d672cc7-1f7a-4f16-a7a5-1bbb089464a7"><figcaption class="center-text">image</figcaption></figure></div><p id="1418898203#-27x798_8">If you are creating multiple port-pairs, it can become difficult to keep track of them. Adopt a numbering scheme which makes it easy to remember the two ends of a port pair - in my example, the port numbers at each end differ by 20. If you are using com0com, you probably don't need to change any of the port parameters from their default settings.</p><p id="1418898203#-27x798_9">Once you have created the port pairs, you need to configure one end of each of them into 101Cats. You can do this through the configuration dialogue box of 101Cats as shown below. Note that the configuration dialogue box does not currently include functionality to add or remove ports from the configuration. The standard configuration file includes six port entries and you can update these to suit your requirements. If you don't need all six, mark some of them as not enabled. If you need more than six, you'll have to manually edit the <span class="control" id="1418898203#-27x798_19">config.xml</span> file.</p><div class="container"><figure class="image-container"><img class="center image image-size" id="1418898203#-27x798_10" alt="image" title="image" src="https://github.com/martinbradford/101Cats/assets/30900693/86c74720-afb8-4554-bc91-f6acd2bd68b0"><figcaption class="center-text">image</figcaption></figure></div><p id="1418898203#-27x798_11">Note that each virtual port configured into 101Cats is one end of a virtual serial port pair - the other end will be used by the corresponding application.

Auto Information is a function of the FTdx101 which can be turned on and off by the application - when it is on, the radio sends a continuous stream of status messages to the application, avoiding the need for the application to poll repeatedly for data. 101Cats is able to replicate the Auto Information stream out to each third-party application but doing so unnecessarily will increase the load on your PC, so try disabling it and checking if the application still works. Auto Information is controllable on a per application basis.</p><section><h2 id="1418898203#omnirig" data-toc="omnirig#Integrating-with-third‐party-applications..topic-omnirig">Omnirig</h2><p id="1418898203#-27x798_21">To Be Completed</p></section></article></div></section><section class="topic"><div><article class="article"><h1 class="main-title" id="-1317807922">Additional Hardware</h1><p id="-1317807922#l1edb_3">101Cats is designed to work with several different external devices that can enhance its operation.
